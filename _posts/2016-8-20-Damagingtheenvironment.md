  Humans are responsibale for a variety of problem environment, but we can also take steps to reduce the damging that we are causing to the planet. This essay will discuss emvironment problems and the measures that goverment and individuals can take to address these problem.
  
  Two of the biggest threats to the environment are air pollution and waste. Gas emissions from factories and exhaust fumes from vehicles lead to global warming. Which may have a devastating effect on the planet in the future. As human population increases, we also producing ever greater quantities of waste. Which contaminates the earth and pollutes rivers and oceans.
  
  The goverment could certainly make more effort to reduce air pollution.They could introduce laws to limit gas emissions from factories or to force companies to use renewable energy from solar, wind or water power. They could also impose "Green taxes" on drivers and airline companies. In this way, people would be encouraged use public transport and to take fewer flights abroad, therefore reducing emissions.
  
  Individuals should also take responsibility for the impact they have on the environment. They could take public transport rather than driving. Choose products with less packaging, and recycle as much as possible. Most supermakets now provide reusable bags for shopper as well as banks for recycling glass, plastic, paper in their car parks. By reusing and recycling. we can help to reduce waste.
  
  In conclusion, both national goverment and individuals must play their part in looking after the environment.
